8th Module Challenge for the Front-End Web Development Bootcamp

## Description

This is my 8th challenge for the bootcamp. I have struggled with this one the most so I focused on getting what I could working rather than the design. I have attended tutoring and the Tuesday office hour to get the app to show the current day's forecast which I managed to achieve. However, I do realised that my code and workflow is a mess and plan to tidy my code up during the week before attempting to tackle this assignment again. I am also aware that I am missing the five day forecast and the functionality of the search history. I will work on both of these once I have cleaned up my javascript.
